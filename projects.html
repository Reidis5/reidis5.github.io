                This design is for a circuit that would take power directly from a standard outlet and use that power to run a temperature sensor for an HVAC system. The design shown uses a bridge rectifier to convert the wall outlet power into 5 volts DC.

                This project is from my Microprocessor Architecture class. We used a microprocessor to initialize an LCD display. Once the display was initialized, we were able to print to the display using a series of functions. In this case, we were displaying the period of a flashing LED.

                This snapshot is from the research I have done with the university. Part of the research project required gathering data from a stationary bicycle's pedals. Because the data was noisy, we needed to run an algorithm on it to smooth it before we could extract information from it.
