            I am a senior at the <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/" target="_blank">University of St. Thomas</a> in St. Paul, Minnesota. I grew up in Sartell, Minnesota and attended Sartell High School. I didn't develop an interest in computer engineering, or computers for that matter, until I came to college and took my first CISC class.
            <br/><br/>
            Since then, I have had a blast learning how I can make peoples lives better through technology. One of my favorite classes in college was my artificial intelligence class where I learned an entire different way of solving complex problems through the use of computers.
            <br/><br/>
            I am incredibly excited to see what the future holds for me. Whether I land a job at any of the companies to the left or take a entirely different path altogether, my biggest goal in life is to be happy with the life that I lead.
